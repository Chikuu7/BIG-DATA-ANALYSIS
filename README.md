## üß© Task 1: Big Data Analysis using PySpark or Dask

### üìò **Overview**

The objective of this task is to perform **data analysis on a large dataset** using big data frameworks such as **PySpark** or **Dask**. These tools are designed to handle and process large-scale datasets efficiently by leveraging distributed computing.
This task demonstrates the ability to work with real-world, high-volume data and extract meaningful **insights, trends, and patterns** that can assist in decision-making.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Purpose**

Traditional tools like pandas work well for small to medium-sized datasets, but they struggle with **memory-intensive operations** when data size exceeds system RAM.
Hence, the main purpose of this task is to:

* Understand **scalable data processing** concepts.
* Work with **distributed computing frameworks**.
* Apply **data cleaning, transformation, and analysis** on large datasets.
* Generate **key insights and visualizations** that summarize important trends.

---

### üß† **Technologies Used**

* **Language:** Python
* **Frameworks/Libraries:**

  * [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/) or [Dask](https://www.dask.org/)
  * Pandas, NumPy (for basic data handling)
  * Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly (for visualization)
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code / PyCharm

---

### üßÆ **Workflow**

1. **Data Collection:**
   Import a large dataset (e.g., CSV or JSON file with millions of records). Examples ‚Äî sales data, weather data, or social media data.

2. **Data Loading:**
   Load the dataset into a PySpark or Dask DataFrame for distributed processing.

3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**

   * Handle missing values, nulls, and duplicates.
   * Convert data types where necessary.
   * Filter irrelevant or erroneous data entries.

4. **Data Transformation:**

   * Apply groupings, aggregations, joins, and sorting using scalable operations.
   * Create derived metrics (e.g., total revenue, average ratings).

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   * Generate descriptive statistics and summaries.
   * Identify correlations or outliers.
   * Visualize key insights using charts (bar, histogram, heatmap, etc.).

6. **Insight Generation:**

   * Highlight business insights such as:

     * Top 10 performing categories or regions
     * Yearly or monthly trends
     * Anomalies or unexpected data patterns

7. **Visualization & Reporting:**

   * Use matplotlib or seaborn to create visuals.
   * Summarize results in a clean, interpretable format.

---

### üìä **Example Use Cases**

* Analyzing large e-commerce transaction data to find top products and revenue trends.
* Processing city-wide weather data to identify seasonal patterns.
* Working with social media datasets to measure engagement metrics.

---

### üßæ **Deliverables**

* A **Python script or Jupyter notebook** containing:

  * Data loading, preprocessing, and analysis steps.
  * Visualizations and summary insights.
* A **summary report or README section** describing the dataset, methods, and findings.

---

### üí° **Expected Outcome**

By completing this task, you‚Äôll demonstrate:

* Proficiency in **handling large datasets** efficiently.
* Understanding of **distributed computing principles**.
* Ability to **analyze and visualize large-scale data** for actionable insights.
* Skills in **PySpark or Dask**, essential for real-world data engineering and analytics roles.
